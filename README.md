# Object Detection with Faster R-CNN

This project uses a pre-trained Faster R-CNN model to perform object detection on uploaded images. The model is capable of identifying various objects in an image, drawing bounding boxes around them, and displaying the results.

## Features

- Upload an image to detect objects in it.
- Use a pre-trained Faster R-CNN model to predict object locations.
- Display the image with bounding boxes around detected objects.
- Supports various object classes from the COCO dataset (e.g., person, car, dog, etc.).

## Requirements

This project requires the following libraries:

- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- PIL (Pillow)
- Matplotlib
- KaggleHub (for loading pre-trained models)
- Google Colab (for file uploading)

Note: This project is designed to work in Google Colab, as it leverages the Colab file upload tool.
